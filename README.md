# ShopifyWebDevApplicationProject

This web app is made for the Shopify UI front end dev challenge. I made it to apply for the shopify winter 2021 Internship. Parameters are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/edit#

It's deployed here:https://gallant-lovelace-415c08.netlify.app .

This app was never submitted in my shopify application because I couldn't figure out that you can't make http api requests in an https app in firefox.
