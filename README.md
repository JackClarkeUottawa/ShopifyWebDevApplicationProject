# ShopifyWebDevApplicationProject

This web app is made for the Shopify UI front end dev challenge. I made it to apply for the shopify winter 2021 Internship. 

It's deployed here:https://gallant-lovelace-415c08.netlify.app .

This app was never submitted in my shopify application because I couldn't figure out that you can't make http api requests in an https app in firefox.
